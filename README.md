SignalR-Auction
===============

This is a really small application just developed to exemplify how to code with SignalR.

**How this Auction works**
- The auction start remaining 1 minute and 30 seconds to finish
- Each bid add 30 seconds to the remaining time
- Each bid add 1 cents to the value of the next bid
- The max value allowed to the remaining time is 1 minute and 30 seconds
- The last person to bid is the winner
